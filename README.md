## Creative Portions: Give Administrator Privilege to Other Users and Display Admins in Rooms

Whenever you create room (with or without password), you become an administrator that gives you privilege to kick or ban other users. However, what if you leave a room and there is a spammer user. Therefore, it would be beneficial to give administrator privilege to other users. If you a creator of the room, click to button "Grant administrator privilege to a user" that pops up a modal.
